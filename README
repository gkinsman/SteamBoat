This project is something I've been working on for a while, but have now brought it together into something that I hope to be quite useful.

The aim is to piggyback on top of yachting software (e.g. Expedition/Deckman) and to broadcast useful information via a REST API out to consumers.
The usage scenario for this is primarily for yacht racing, as having up to date information can be vital for decision making and it's not very useful if it's downstairs only.

The kind of information returned 

In it's current form, the application is built on top of the WCF Web Api (currently in preview 6) and hosted in IIS. Web Api apps can be hosted
in anything, but IIS is the current target given its ease of deployment.
